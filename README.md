# Project Zoo - Author Kersji Mallea

# Why are we doing this project?

The aim of this project is to put in practice what we've learnt about Java, Spring Boot, HTML, Javascript, APIs, Eclipse, Visual Studio Code, Postman and MySQL.

Using the knowledge acquired on the backend programming, we will demonstrate the following:

1.	How to define a table structure
2.	How to write the codes for the various packages such as the domain, controller, repo and service. 
3.	How to link the repo to the domain, the service to the repo and controller to the service.
4.	How to write data to a database using Spring Boot
5.	Testing the backend using Postman
 

Similarly, using the knowledge acquired on the frontend programming, we will demonstrate the following:

1.	How to design the Forms for the frontend 
2.	How to use bootstrap to design the frontend 
3.	How to use Javascript to display data on the frontend
4.	How to use Axios to Read/Write/Update/Delete data from the backend database
5.	How to design a frontend application 

# How I expected the challenge to go?

I was confident that I could write the codes for both the backend and frontend applications. I was expecting some challenges on the frontend development such as using stylesheets, date manipulation and displaying the data from the database in a table on the frontend. 

# What went well?
1.	I have successfully written the codes for both the backend and frontend applications. 
2.	I have also written the data on disk using MySQL.  
3.	I have written a user interface to the best of my abilities using the knowledge I have acquired during the training.
4.	The user interface provides the following functionality
- Search for an animal using the Animal Id
- Add an animal to the database
- Amend the data for an animal 
- Remove an animal from the database
- Clear display functionality to clear all fields on the screen before creating an animal
5.	I have also catered for the error message as part of the user input for the animal id.

# What didn't go as planned?

I was unable to write the codes to display the data from the database in a table on the frontend (Refresh Animal List button). I was able to retrieve the data from the table but evenetually gave up on writing the codes as I couldn't get it to work.

Having spent so much time on the table I was unable to look further into using the bootstrap stylesheet, check boxes for one character field and dates. Consequently, I have used string for the dates and haven't done any checks on the values entered on the screen other than the animal id entry.

# Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
1.	Displaying the data from the database in a table on the frontend
2.	Performing the checks on the data entered by the user where applicable before updating the database
3.	Using check boxes where appropriate
4.	Overlaying the forms so that the buttons can be on the left hand side and data displayed on the right handside of the screen.
